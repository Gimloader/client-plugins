FixCrashes attempts to prevent all game crashes, with the exception of things that are only caused by modding the game.

Currently this fixes the following crashes:
- Dropping an item as soon as you switch to its slot
- Maps that abuse custom shapes and consume beyond the permitted memory amount of browser tabs (eg. [Industrial Parkour](https://www.gimkit.com/creative/map/67b0c7acfa81c547951806cb))
