# DLD Timer

Install the plugin by clicking [here](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimloader/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader/main/plugins/DLDTimer/build/DLDTimer.js) while having Gimloader downloaded.

## Features

Automatically records the times of your runs and summits in Don't Look Down with frame-perfect accuracy. It will automatically start timing when you begin summit one, and stop when you reach the finish. The timing was made with the help of Retrozy, and should be compliant with the way speedruns are timed. This plugin will attempt to guess the category you are running based on the other active plugins, but it can be changed with the dropdown on the UI.

## Resetting Data

You can reset your run count, personal best and best splits for each category in the settings menu.
