# InputRecorder

## Installation

Click [here](https://gimloader.github.io/install/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/plugins/InputRecorder/build/InputRecorder.js) to install the plugin with Gimloader downloaded.

## Usage

This is a modified version of [DLDTAS](../DLDTAS) that only records inputs and allows for playback. As far as I'm aware, this is allowed for speedrun proof if you have a really bad computer. Hit alt+r to start/stop recording, and alt+b to play back a recording.
