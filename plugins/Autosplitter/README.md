# Autosplitter

Install the plugin by clicking [here](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimloader/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader/main/plugins/Autosplitter/build/Autosplitter.js) while having Gimloader downloaded.

## Features

Automatically records the times of your runs and summits in various gamemodes with frame-perfect accuracy.

### Don't Look Down

The timer will automatically start timing when you begin summit one, and stop when you reach the finish. The timing was made with the help of Retrozy, and should be compliant with the way speedruns are timed. This plugin will attempt to guess the category you are running based on the other active plugins, but it can be changed with the dropdown on the UI.

#### Running Individual Summits

In order to run individual summits switch the dropdown from "Full Game" to the desired summit. If you are not running current patch, you will also be able to select between "Preboosts" and "No preboosts". Preboosts allows you to begin the summit with speed, while No preboosts will require you to be respawned at the start of the summit. In order to do this, you will need the [Savestates](../Savestates.js) plugin which can be downloaded by clicking [here](https://thelazysquid.github.io/gimloader/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheLazySquid/Gimloader/main/plugins/Savestates.js). When running preboosts, the run begins when crossing over the area where you would spawn, and when running preboosts the run begins upon the first input after teleporting to a summit.

### Fishtopia

The timer will automatically start and split upon entering each unique zone.

## Resetting Data

You can reset your run count, personal best and best splits for each category in the settings menu.
