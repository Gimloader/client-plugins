## [SaveGameOptions](./SaveGameOptions.js)

This plugin will automatically save and load settings for live games between sessions.

## [CameraControl](./CameraControl.js)

When using this plugin you can scroll and your camera will zoom in and out. You can also hit Shift + F to enable freecam, which you can move around with the arrow keys. Zooming out to much can lead to lag or crashes.
