# DLDTAS

This is a plugin that allows you to record and playback TASes in Don't Look Down.

## Installation

Copy the plugin from [here](./build/DLDTAS.js) and paste it into Gimloader.

## Usage

When you start a game, a "Start TAS" button will appear in the top left. Clicking this will teleport you to the starting position and open the input table. Check the boxes for left, right and jump to set what the input will be on that frame. Use the right and left arrow to step forwards and backwards (hold shift to move by 5). The currently active frame is highlighted in blue. To play the TAS, hit the play button at the top. You can also import and export TASes as JSON files.
