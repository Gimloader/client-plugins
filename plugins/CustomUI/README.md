# CustomUI

This plugin lets you customize a few things about the Gimkit UI. Most importantly, it lets you make and use custom themes in both 1d and 2d modes.

## Installation

Click [here](https://gimloader.github.io/install/?installUrl=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Gimloader/client-plugins/main/plugins/CustomUI/build/CustomUI.js) to install the plugin with Gimloader downloaded.

## Usage

The settings menu can be accessed from the plugins menu when the plugin is enabled. There are a few things that can be changed.

1. Auto Hide Top Bar - This will make the bar at the top of the screen in 2d gamemodes slide away when you're not hovering over it.
2. Question Panel Opacity - This will change how opaque the question panel is in 2d gamemodes.
3. Custom Theme - This will let you choose a custom theme to use. This comes with all the default themes that Gimkit has, and it also has the option to make your own custom themes.
